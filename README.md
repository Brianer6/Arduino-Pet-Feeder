# Arduino-Pet-Feeder-
# Arduino-Pet-Feeder It's an Arduino Pet Food dispenser. When you press a button on the dispenser the Servo rotates 180째 in order to let out the food. I'm hoping to remove the button so it can be automatic so at a certain time the Servo will move 180째 to let the feed out. Let me know what else i could add. It's an Arduino Pet Food dispenser.
